# ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Classification with Machine Learning

This project evaluates and compares multiple **machine learning algorithms** for **breast cancer classification** using the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**. The models analyzed include:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Logistic Regression**

Each model is optimized and evaluated using key performance metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: How many predicted positives are actually positive.
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: How many actual positives were correctly identified.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC Score**: Measures how well the model differentiates between classes.
